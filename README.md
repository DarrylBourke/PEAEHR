Principles of Epidemiology Applied to Electronic Health Records (PEAEHR)

Research Question:
Reducing antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections is important for preventing antibiotic resistance. There is a concern however that reduced antibiotic prescribing may lead to more hospital admissions among those who are particularly at risk of complications. Design a study using Electronic Health Records to identify which groups of patients have the highest risk of hospitalisation following an acute respiratory infection to help GPs target antibiotic use.
